Created a well-formatted time plot of the data using Python.

For a closer view of the patterns, zoomed in to the range of 3500–5000 on the y-axis.

Created one chart with four separate lines, one line for each of Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. Then grouped the data frame by quarter and then plot shipment versus year for each quarter as a separate series on a line graph. Zoom in to the range of 3500–5000 on the y-axis.

Designed a scatter plot of Lot Size vs. Income, color-coded by the outcome variable owner/nonowner. Made sure to obtain a well-formatted plot (produced legible labels and a legend, etc.)

Built a bar chart showing the average retail price by store. To better compare retail prices across stores, made side-by-side boxplots of retail price by store
